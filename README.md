# Visualization-market-project

## Project made for the birthday of one of my friend

The code creates an interactive Streamlit interface for dynamic pricing management of drinks during a student party. The price varies based on recent purchases and the time elapsed since the last purchase, simulating a market environment. Users can view the evolution of prices in real-time, record purchases, and export historical data.

## Change and Reflection
Of course, this project can be approached in a completely different way, but with the aim of only regulating the price of a drink over a period, the goal is to make this price tend towards a positive return for the seller and providing a market sensation for consumers. Here, since there are only buyers and not sellers, we cannot rely on an order book. Therefore, we base our approach on supply and demand. The higher the demand, the more expensive it gets and vice versa.
